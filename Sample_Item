Project Files
1. pubspec.yaml
This file manages your project's dependencies and metadata. Make sure the shared_preferences dependency is added as shown below.

Note: After modifying pubspec.yaml, save the file and run flutter pub get in your terminal to fetch the new dependency.

2. lib/task.dart
This file defines the Task data model and is independent of the app's name, so its content remains the same.

3. lib/main.dart
This is the main application file, where the app's display name "ChronoPlan" is set in MaterialApp.

How to Implement and Run
Open your scheduler_app project in your IDE.
Verify pubspec.yaml: Ensure shared_preferences: ^2.3.1 is correctly added. Run flutter pub get if you haven't already.
Verify lib/task.dart: Make sure its content matches the provided code.
Update lib/main.dart: Replace the entire content of your existing lib/main.dart file with the code from Section 3.
Save all files.
Run the App:
Perform a full hot restart (Shift + R in the terminal where flutter run is active, or the "Restart" button in your IDE). This ensures all changes, including the app name, are picked up.
Now, your app will display "ChronoPlan" as its name in the recent apps list and potentially in the app launcher (depending on how the platform-specific manifest files are configured, which is a separate step usually done during deployment, but MaterialApp's title is the main Flutter-side setting).
